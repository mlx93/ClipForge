# Recording Issues Analysis & Fixes

## ‚úÖ **FIXED: App Won't Open (Black Screen)**
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors in `VideoPreview.tsx` caused the app to fail to build/launch.
**Solution**: Fixed `video` variable reference in `handlePlay` function by using `videoRef.current`.
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - App now builds and launches successfully.

## üîç **INVESTIGATING: Recording Timer Not Incrementing**
**Problem**: Timer stays at 0:00 during recording instead of counting up.
**Current Status**: Added debug logging to `setRecordingTime` function to identify the issue.
**Possible Causes**:
1. Timer interval not starting properly
2. `setRecordingTime` function not being called
3. State update not triggering re-render
4. Timer being cleared prematurely

**Debug Steps**:
- Added console logging to track timer updates
- Check browser console for `[Recording Store] Updating time:` messages
- Verify interval is being set and cleared properly

## üîç **INVESTIGATING: Resolution/Frame Rate Dropdowns Empty**
**Problem**: Dropdowns appear empty until clicked, no default values visible.
**Current Status**: Dropdowns have `bg-white` class and proper `value` attributes.
**Possible Causes**:
1. CSS styling issue hiding default text
2. Default values not being set in store
3. Browser rendering issue with select elements

**Current Implementation**:
```tsx
<select
  value={`${settings.resolution.width}x${settings.resolution.height}`}
  className="w-full p-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md bg-white"
>
  <option value="1920x1080">1920x1080 (1080p)</option>
  <option value="1280x720">1280x720 (720p)</option>
  <option value="854x480">854x480 (480p)</option>
</select>
```

## üîç **INVESTIGATING: Recording Not Saving After Stop**
**Problem**: After stopping recording, nothing happens and video doesn't appear.
**Current Status**: Logic appears correct with proper blob creation and save flow.
**Possible Causes**:
1. `recordingBlob` not being created from chunks
2. IPC handler not working properly
3. File save failing silently
4. Import to media library failing

**Current Flow**:
1. Recording stops ‚Üí `chunks` array populated
2. `useEffect` creates `Blob` from chunks ‚Üí `setRecordingBlob(blob)`
3. User clicks "Save Recording" ‚Üí `saveRecording()` function
4. Blob converted to ArrayBuffer ‚Üí IPC call to `saveRecording`
5. File saved ‚Üí IPC call to `importVideos`

## üîç **INVESTIGATING: Load Error Importing Recorded Clip**
**Problem**: Error when importing recorded clip into media library.
**Current Status**: Need to check IPC handlers and error handling.
**Possible Causes**:
1. File path issues in IPC handlers
2. Video file format not supported
3. Media library store not handling new clips properly
4. File permissions or access issues

## üß™ **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Start recording ‚Üí check console for timer debug messages
- [ ] Check if dropdowns show default values on page load
- [ ] Complete recording ‚Üí check if blob is created
- [ ] Save recording ‚Üí check if file is created and imported
- [ ] Check browser console for any error messages

## üìÅ **Files Modified**
- `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript errors
- `src/renderer/store/recordingStore.ts` - Added debug logging
- `src/renderer/components/RecordingPanel.tsx` - (Already had fixes)

## üéØ **Next Steps**
1. Test the app with debug logging to identify timer issue
2. Check browser console for any error messages
3. Verify IPC handlers are working correctly
4. Test complete recording flow end-to-end
