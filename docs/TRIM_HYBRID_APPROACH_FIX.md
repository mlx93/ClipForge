# Trim Hybrid Approach Fix

## Problem
Previous attempts to get both features working together failed:
- Videos couldn't start playing from trim start (immediate pause)
- Videos couldn't start playing from after trim end (blocked)
- Complex logic was causing conflicts between the two requirements

## Solution: Hybrid Approach
Implemented a hybrid approach that treats trim start and trim end differently:

### Trim Start Behavior
- **No auto-pause** when crossing into trim start
- **Videos can play through** trim start boundary
- **Videos can start playing** from trim start position
- **Videos can start playing** from before trim start

### Trim End Behavior  
- **Auto-pause** when crossing into trim end (preserved existing logic)
- **Videos can start playing** from after trim end
- **Videos can start playing** from trim end position

## Implementation
```typescript
// Check for boundary crossings while video is actively playing
// Hybrid approach: No pause at trim start, pause at trim end
if (!video.paused) {
  // TRIM END: Videos must pause when crossing into trim end
  const wasBeforeTrimEnd = previousTime < effectiveTrimEnd - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE;
  const isAtOrPastTrimEnd = currentTime >= effectiveTrimEnd - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE;
  
  if (wasBeforeTrimEnd && isAtOrPastTrimEnd) {
    // Auto-pause at trim end
    video.pause();
    video.currentTime = effectiveTrimEnd;
    setIsPlaying(false);
    return;
  }
  
  // TRIM START: No auto-pause - videos can play through trim start
  // This allows videos to start playing from trim start position without immediate pause
}
```

## Behavior Now
✅ **Videos can start playing from trim start** (no immediate pause)
✅ **Videos can play through trim start** (no auto-pause at trim start)
✅ **Videos can start playing from after trim end** (no blocking)
✅ **Videos can start playing from trim end** (no blocking)
✅ **Videos pause when crossing into trim end** (preserved existing logic)
✅ **All pauses are resumable by the user**

## UX Benefits
- **Intuitive trim start**: Users can scrub to trim start and play without interruption
- **Clear trim end**: Videos stop at trim end as expected in video editing
- **Flexible playback**: Users can start playback from any position
- **Consistent behavior**: Trim end acts like a "stop" boundary, trim start acts like a "begin" marker

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start playback at trim start → should work without immediate pause ✅
- [ ] Start playback at trim end → should work without immediate pause ✅
- [ ] Start playback after trim end → should work without blocking ✅
- [ ] Play from before trim start → should continue through trim start ✅
- [ ] Play from before trim end → should pause when reaching trim end ✅
- [ ] After auto-pause at trim end, manually resume → should continue playing ✅

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` - Implemented hybrid trim boundary logic

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Hybrid trim approach provides optimal UX for both boundaries
