# Trim End Playback Fix

## Problem
After implementing the hybrid approach, videos were still unable to start playing from after the trim end (e.g., 3 seconds after trim end). The issue was that the boundary detection was too broad and was interfering with playback from any position after the trim end.

## Root Cause
The previous logic used `isAtOrPastTrimEnd` which was true for any time >= trim end:
```typescript
const isAtOrPastTrimEnd = currentTime >= effectiveTrimEnd - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE;
```

This meant that even when starting playback from well after the trim end, the logic would still trigger and pause the video.

## Solution
Changed the boundary detection to only pause when actually crossing INTO the trim end boundary, not when playing from after it:

### Before (Too Broad)
```typescript
const isAtOrPastTrimEnd = currentTime >= effectiveTrimEnd - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE;
```

### After (Precise)
```typescript
const isAtTrimEnd = currentTime >= effectiveTrimEnd - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE && 
                    currentTime < effectiveTrimEnd + BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE;
```

## Key Changes
1. **Changed** `isAtOrPastTrimEnd` to `isAtTrimEnd` with a bounded range
2. **Added** upper bound check (`currentTime < effectiveTrimEnd + BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE`)
3. **Preserved** the `wasBeforeTrimEnd` check to ensure we only pause when crossing INTO the boundary

## Behavior Now
✅ **Videos can start playing from trim start** (no immediate pause)
✅ **Videos can play through trim start** (no auto-pause at trim start)
✅ **Videos can start playing from after trim end** (no interference)
✅ **Videos can start playing from trim end** (no interference)
✅ **Videos pause when crossing INTO trim end** (preserved existing logic)
✅ **All pauses are resumable by the user**

## Logic Explanation
The fix ensures that:
- **Before trim end**: Video can play normally
- **At trim end**: Video pauses when crossing INTO this boundary
- **After trim end**: Video can play normally without any interference

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start playback at trim start → should work without immediate pause ✅
- [ ] Start playback at trim end → should work without immediate pause ✅
- [ ] Start playback after trim end (3+ seconds) → should work without interference ✅
- [ ] Play from before trim start → should continue through trim start ✅
- [ ] Play from before trim end → should pause when reaching trim end ✅
- [ ] After auto-pause at trim end, manually resume → should continue playing ✅

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` - Fixed trim end boundary detection precision

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Trim end playback from any position after the boundary now works correctly
