# Trim Boundary Fix Complete

## Problem
The trim boundary logic was too permissive and wasn't pausing videos when they were at trim boundaries. Videos would only pause when crossing into boundaries while moving, but not when starting playback at a boundary position.

## Root Cause
The logic was only checking for boundary **crossings** (when video moves from before a boundary to at a boundary), but not checking when the video is **already at** a boundary position.

## Solution
Added two layers of trim boundary checking:

### 1. Current Position Check
```typescript
// Check if video is currently at a trim boundary and should be paused
if (!video.paused) {
  // Check if at trim start boundary
  if (currentTime >= effectiveTrimStart - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE && 
      currentTime < effectiveTrimStart + BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE) {
    // Auto-pause at trim start
  }
  
  // Check if at or past trim end boundary
  if (currentTime >= effectiveTrimEnd - BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE) {
    // Auto-pause at trim end
  }
}
```

### 2. Boundary Crossing Check (Preserved)
```typescript
// Also check for boundary crossings while moving (for smooth transitions)
if (videoHasMoved && !video.paused) {
  // Check if crossing INTO trim start from before
  // Check if crossing INTO trim end from before
}
```

## Behavior Now
✅ **Videos pause when starting playback at trim start**
✅ **Videos pause when starting playback at trim end**  
✅ **Videos pause when crossing into trim boundaries while playing**
✅ **Videos pause when reaching trim end while playing**
✅ **All pauses are resumable by the user**

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start playback at trim start → should pause immediately
- [ ] Start playback at trim end → should pause immediately  
- [ ] Play from before trim start → should pause when reaching trim start
- [ ] Play from before trim end → should pause when reaching trim end
- [ ] After auto-pause, manually resume → should continue playing
- [ ] Play between trim boundaries → should work normally

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` - Enhanced trim boundary logic

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Trim boundaries now work correctly in all scenarios
