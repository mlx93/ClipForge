# Export UI Improvements - ClipForge

## Summary
Enhanced the export experience with improved visual feedback, automatic dialog management, and file overwrite protection. All improvements are purely UI/UX enhancements that don't modify the critical FFmpeg export logic.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Progress Display ✅

**Visual Improvements:**
- **Animated Progress Bar**: Gradient blue bar with smooth 500ms transitions
- **Percentage Inside Bar**: Shows percentage number within the progress bar when > 10%
- **Percentage Display**: Clear "X% complete" text below the bar
- **Estimated Time Remaining**: Dynamic calculation showing "Xm Ys remaining"
  - Only shows after 5% progress for accuracy
  - Format: "45s remaining" or "2m 30s remaining"
  - Updates in real-time as export progresses

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate estimated time based on elapsed time and progress
if (currentProgress > 5) {
  const elapsedTime = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000;
  const progressDecimal = currentProgress / 100;
  const totalEstimatedTime = elapsedTime / progressDecimal;
  estimatedTimeRemaining = Math.max(0, totalEstimatedTime - elapsedTime);
}
```

### 2. Auto-Close Export Dialog ✅

**Behavior:**
- Export dialog automatically closes 1.5 seconds after successful export
- Toast notification remains visible to confirm completion
- Smooth transition with 300ms delay for state reset
- User can still manually close the dialog at any time

**User Experience:**
1. Export completes → Progress shows 100%
2. Toast appears: "Export complete! Saved to filename.mp4"
3. After 1.5 seconds → Dialog smoothly closes
4. Toast remains visible for user confirmation

### 3. File Overwrite Protection ✅

**Confirmation Dialog:**
- Checks if output file exists before starting export
- Shows native confirmation dialog with clear message:
  ```
  A file named "filename.mp4" already exists at this location.
  
  Do you want to replace it with the new export?
  
  Choosing "OK" will overwrite the existing file.
  ```
- User can choose:
  - **OK**: Proceed with export and overwrite
  - **Cancel**: Return to export dialog without starting

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Check file existence via IPC
const fileCheck = await window.electronAPI.checkFileExists(settings.outputPath);

if (fileCheck.exists) {
  const fileName = settings.outputPath.split('/').pop();
  const confirmed = confirm(/* message */);
  if (!confirmed) return; // Cancel export
}
```

## Files Modified

### Renderer Process (UI)
1. **src/renderer/components/ExportDialog.tsx**
   - Added file existence check before export
   - Enhanced progress UI with percentage and time display
   - Improved progress bar styling with gradient and animation

2. **src/renderer/store/exportStore.ts**
   - Added `estimatedTimeRemaining` and `exportStartTime` to state
   - Implemented real-time time estimation calculation
   - Added auto-close logic with 1.5 second delay
   - Updated all reset functions to include new state fields

### Main Process (Backend)
3. **src/main/ipc/handlers.ts**
   - Added `check-file-exists` IPC handler
   - Uses fs.access() to check file existence

### IPC Bridge
4. **src/preload/preload.ts**
   - Exposed `checkFileExists` API to renderer process
   - Added TypeScript type definitions

### Types
5. **src/shared/types.ts**
   - Added `estimatedTimeRemaining: number | null` to ExportState
   - Added `exportStartTime: number | null` to ExportState

## Critical FFmpeg Logic - UNCHANGED ✅

**NO MODIFICATIONS** were made to:
- ✅ `src/main/ffmpeg.ts` - FFmpeg export implementation
- ✅ `src/main/fileSystem.ts` - Video metadata extraction
- ✅ Filter chain architecture (complexFilter vs videoFilters)
- ✅ Module import patterns (require() for fluent-ffmpeg)

All changes are purely UI/UX enhancements in the renderer process.

## Testing Checklist

### Progress Display
- [ ] Progress bar animates smoothly from 0% to 100%
- [ ] Percentage number displays inside bar when > 10%
- [ ] "X% complete" text shows below bar
- [ ] Estimated time appears after 5% progress
- [ ] Time format is readable ("45s" or "2m 30s")
- [ ] Time estimation updates during export

### Auto-Close
- [ ] Dialog remains open during export
- [ ] Toast notification appears on completion
- [ ] Dialog closes automatically after 1.5 seconds
- [ ] State resets cleanly after close
- [ ] User can manually close dialog before auto-close

### File Overwrite
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears when file exists
- [ ] Dialog shows correct filename
- [ ] Clicking OK proceeds with export
- [ ] Clicking Cancel returns to export dialog
- [ ] Export starts normally when file doesn't exist

### Integration
- [ ] Single clip export works (with/without scaling)
- [ ] Multi-clip export works (with/without scaling)
- [ ] All resolution options work (Source, 720p, 1080p, 4K)
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Cancel button still works during export

## User Benefits

1. **Better Feedback**: Users can see exactly how far along the export is and how long it will take
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Dialog auto-closes so users don't have to manually dismiss it
3. **Prevented Mistakes**: Confirmation prevents accidental file overwrites
4. **Professional Feel**: Smooth animations and clear feedback create a polished experience

## Technical Notes

- All time calculations use `Date.now()` for accuracy
- Progress updates come from FFmpeg via IPC (unchanged)
- File checking uses Node.js `fs.access()` for reliability
- Auto-close uses setTimeout with proper cleanup
- All state management follows existing Zustand patterns

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Export logic completely unchanged
- Backwards compatible with all existing projects
- No database or file format changes required
