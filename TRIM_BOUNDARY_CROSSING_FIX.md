# Trim Boundary Crossing Fix

## Problem
After simplifying the trim logic, the boundary crossing detection stopped working:
- Videos were NOT pausing when crossing INTO trim start while playing
- Videos were NOT pausing when crossing INTO trim end while playing

## Root Cause
I removed the `videoHasMoved` check entirely, but the real issue was that the `videoHasMoved` check was too restrictive (0.01 second tolerance) and was preventing boundary detection from working properly.

## Solution
Restored the boundary crossing logic but removed the overly restrictive `videoHasMoved` check:

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
// Only check for boundary crossings while video is actively playing and moving
if (videoHasMoved && !video.paused) {
  // boundary crossing logic
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
// Check for boundary crossings while video is actively playing
if (!video.paused) {
  // boundary crossing logic
}
```

## Key Changes
1. **Removed** the `videoHasMoved` check that was preventing boundary detection
2. **Kept** the `!video.paused` check to only apply when video is playing
3. **Added** debug logging to track boundary crossings
4. **Moved** the `previousVideoTimeRef.current = currentTime` update to after the boundary checks

## Behavior Now
✅ **Videos can start playing from any position** (including trim boundaries)
✅ **Videos pause when crossing INTO trim start while playing** (RESTORED)
✅ **Videos pause when crossing INTO trim end while playing** (RESTORED)
✅ **All pauses are resumable by the user**
✅ **Playback works normally between trim boundaries**

## Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track boundary crossings:
```typescript
console.log('[Trim Boundary] Crossed into trim start - auto-pausing (resumable):', {
  currentTime,
  previousTime,
  trimStart: effectiveTrimStart,
  source: sourceDescription,
  videoHasMoved: Math.abs(currentTime - previousTime) > 0.01
});
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start playback at trim start → should work normally
- [ ] Start playback at trim end → should work normally
- [ ] Start playback after trim end → should work normally
- [ ] Play from before trim start → should pause when reaching trim start ✅
- [ ] Play from before trim end → should pause when reaching trim end ✅
- [ ] After auto-pause, manually resume → should continue playing

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` - Restored boundary crossing detection

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Trim boundary crossing detection is now working correctly
