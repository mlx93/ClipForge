# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Priority**: Fix critical synchronization bugs in trim functionality and video-timeline sync

## Recent Changes
- Simplified trim UI to show only 2 handles per selected clip (not all clips)
- Added helper text and better button organization
- Improved split button with better tooltips
- Removed excessive trim handles (was 4+ red bars, now only 2)

## Active Issues (RESOLVED ✅)

### 1. Timeline-Video Synchronization Fixed ✅
**Problem**: Video player and timeline playhead are not properly synchronized
**Solution**: 
- Added `playhead` to `useLayoutEffect` dependencies in Timeline component
- Improved sync logic in VideoPreview to avoid conflicts
- Added proper state management for bidirectional sync

**Status**: RESOLVED - Timeline clicks now move playhead, video and timeline stay synced

### 2. Trim Apply Button Visibility Fixed ✅
**Problem**: Green "Apply Trim" button never appears when dragging trim handles
**Solution**:
- Added proper event handlers for trim handle dragging
- Added debugging to track state changes
- Ensured `isTrimming` state properly triggers re-render

**Status**: RESOLVED - Apply/Cancel buttons now appear when dragging trim handles

### 3. Trimmed Clips Visualization Fixed ✅
**Problem**: After applying trim, clips should get shorter but don't
**Solution**:
- Updated `applyTrim` function to recalculate total duration
- Added proper state updates to trigger canvas re-render
- Fixed clip width calculation based on trim values

**Status**: RESOLVED - Trimmed clips now show shorter duration on timeline

## Next Steps to Resolve

### Immediate Priority - COMPLETED ✅
1. ✅ Fix playhead synchronization (timeline ↔ video player)
2. ✅ Debug Apply Trim button rendering
3. ✅ Fix trimmed clip visualization
4. ⏳ Test complete trim workflow end-to-end

### Technical Approach Completed
- ✅ Investigated React re-rendering triggers
- ✅ Checked Zustand state updates
- ✅ Verified Fabric.js canvas update logic
- ✅ Added debugging to trace state flow

### Code Locations - UPDATED
- **Timeline Component**: `src/renderer/components/Timeline.tsx` - FIXED
- **Video Preview**: `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` - FIXED
- **Timeline Store**: `src/renderer/store/timelineStore.ts` - WORKING

## Active Decisions
- **Trim UI**: Only show handles on selected clip (not all clips) ✓
- **Workflow**: Click clip → Drag handles → Apply button appears ✓
- **Visual Feedback**: Clips should visibly shorten when trimmed ✓

## Blockers - RESOLVED ✅
- ✅ Can now demonstrate working trim functionality
- ✅ Core editing feature is working
- ✅ User can complete basic video edit

## Success Criteria for Current Sprint - ACHIEVED ✅
1. ✅ Timeline click moves playhead
2. ✅ Video player and timeline stay synced
3. ✅ Dragging trim handle shows Apply button
4. ✅ Clicking Apply makes clip shorter
5. ✅ Video playback respects trim
