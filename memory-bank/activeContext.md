# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Priority**: Export Functionality Fixed ✅ - Core App Complete

## Recent Changes (Last 7 Commits)

### Commit 05ea803 - FFmpeg Export Errors Fixed (CRITICAL) ✅
- **Problem 1**: TypeError: ffmpeg.input is not a function
  - Root cause: Vite's `_interopNamespaceDefault` helper converting fluent-ffmpeg function to non-callable object
  - ESM imports with TypeScript's esModuleInterop triggered namespace wrapping bug
  - Function properties copied but callable nature lost
- **Solution 1**: 
  - Replaced ESM `import` with direct `require()` calls for fluent-ffmpeg
  - Updated src/main/ffmpeg.ts and src/main/fileSystem.ts
  - Bypasses Vite's interop helpers, preserves function type
- **Problem 2**: FFmpeg filter conflict error
  - Error: "Filtergraph was specified through -vf option... which is fed from a complex filtergraph"
  - Root cause: Using both videoFilters() and complexFilter() on same stream
  - FFmpeg doesn't allow mixing -vf and -filter_complex flags
- **Solution 2**:
  - Single clips: Use videoFilters() for scaling
  - Multiple clips: Integrate scaling into complexFilter chain
  - Filter chain example: `[0:v][0:a][1:v][1:a]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[v][a];[v]scale=...[outv]`
- **Impact**: Export functionality fully operational, all resolution options working
- **Documentation**: Created FFMPEG_EXPORT_FIX.md with comprehensive technical analysis
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This export logic documented in systemPatterns.md - DO NOT modify without review

### Commit 6a399e1 - Complete UI Polish & Trim Persistence (All Issues Resolved) ✅
- **Problem**: Multiple UX issues with trim persistence, button visibility, and media library display
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Both trim handles now preserve position after video playback (left and right)
  - Reorder and Split buttons always visible during trim mode
  - Media library clip names display with wrapping (no truncation)
  - Apply/Cancel buttons repositioned before zoom controls
  - Clip colors reversed correctly (selected = light blue, unselected = dark blue)
- **Solutions**:
  - Check `wasAlreadySelected` using fresh state from Zustand store
  - Only reset trim values when selecting a DIFFERENT clip
  - Changed MediaLibrary to use 2-line wrapping with -webkit-line-clamp
  - Removed `!isTrimming` condition from reorder/split button visibility
  - Repositioned trim buttons to left of zoom controls
  - Updated all color references with new scheme
- **Impact**: All user-reported issues resolved, trim workflow now fully stable and intuitive

### Commit 59ddc39 - Timeline Trim Drag Fix (Critical) ✅
- **Problem**: Trim handles could not be dragged - they immediately got stuck
- **Root Cause**: `isDraggingRef` skip logic was only in resize observer effect, not main rendering effect
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Missing `handleWidth` variable declaration in event handler scope
  - Stale closure problem - event handlers capturing old state values
  - Main canvas re-render effect destroying trim handles during drag
  - TypeScript errors with Fabric.js Line properties
- **Solutions**:
  - Moved `handleWidth` to top of useLayoutEffect scope
  - All event handlers now fetch fresh state via `useTimelineStore.getState()`
  - Added isDraggingRef skip check to MAIN rendering effect (line 286-290)
  - Used functional setState pattern for trim value initialization
  - Cast Line objects to `any` when setting x1/x2 properties
  - Enhanced Apply Trim with progress tracking, error handling, unique file naming
  - Added visual progress bar and IPC progress listener
- **Impact**: Trim functionality now fully operational - handles drag smoothly, state updates correctly, video shortens accurately

### Commit 1166f23 - Memory Bank Documentation Update ✅
- **Purpose**: Updated memory bank to reflect all recent timeline and trim fixes
- **Changes**: Comprehensive documentation of all completed fixes and improvements
- **Impact**: Memory bank now accurately reflects current project state

### Commit d719fc8 - Timeline & Trim Functionality Fixes ✅
- **Problem**: Critical timeline and trim regressions after zoom implementation
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Timeline width regression (canvas appearing tiny)
  - Zoom coordinate system broken (positioning errors)
  - Canvas re-rendering interrupting trim handle drag operations
  - Trim values not updating during drag
  - Apply Trim using fallback values instead of actual trim values
  - Playhead not following trim handles
- **Solutions**:
  - Removed zoom from canvas width calculations (viewport transform only)
  - Fixed coordinate calculations for zoom
  - Added `isDraggingRef` to track drag state and prevent canvas re-renders
  - Implemented video pause/resume during trim operations
  - Enhanced trim value initialization and state management
  - Increased media library width (320px → 384px)
- **Impact**: Timeline and trim functionality fully operational with smooth drag operations

### Commit b0df0b3 - Bundle Size Optimization ✅
- **Problem**: 500+ kB bundle size causing slow startup and warnings
- **Solution**: Implemented code splitting and lazy loading
- **Results**: 
  - Main bundle: 9.00 kB (was 500+ kB)
  - Vendor chunks: React (141kB), Fabric.js (310kB), Zustand (3.6kB)
  - Feature chunks: Timeline (14kB), Video (9kB), Export (9kB), Project (5kB)
  - Lazy loading for ExportDialog and ProjectMenu
- **Impact**: Faster app startup, better caching, no bundle warnings

### Commit 2e90c33 - Complete Polish Features ✅
- **Timeline Zoom**: Fixed zoom functionality with proper viewport transform
- **Project Save/Load**: Full project management with .clipforge files
- **Application Menu**: macOS-style menu with keyboard shortcuts
- **Export Preview**: Enhanced dialog with settings summary and thumbnail

## Completed Fixes ✅

### 1. Timeline Width Regression - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Timeline appeared tiny on app start despite full-width CSS
**Solution**: 
- Removed zoom multiplication from canvas dimensions
- Canvas now uses full container width regardless of zoom level
- Zoom applied via viewport transform for visual scaling only

### 2. Zoom Coordinate System - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: All positioning calculations used zoom incorrectly
**Solution**:
- Implemented proper viewport transform: `canvas.setViewportTransform([zoom, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])`
- Updated coordinate calculations to account for viewport transform
- Click-to-seek coordinates now work correctly
- Trim handle positions calculated properly

### 3. Trim Functionality - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: tempTrimStart and tempTrimEnd not initialized when clicking clips
**Solution**:
- Added trim value initialization when selecting clips
- Apply Trim button now appears when dragging trim handles
- Playhead follows trim handles correctly

### 4. Playhead Positioning - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Playhead positioning broken due to zoom multiplication errors
**Solution**:
- Fixed playhead coordinate calculations
- Playhead now follows trim handles during drag operations
- Timeline click-to-seek works correctly

### 5. Canvas Re-Rendering During Drag - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Canvas was re-rendering during trim handle drag operations, interrupting the drag
**Solution**:
- Added `isDraggingRef` to track when user is dragging trim handles
- Skip canvas re-render in `useLayoutEffect` when `isDraggingRef.current === true`
- Set flag to `true` on `object:moving` event start
- Clear flag to `false` on `object:modified` event (drag end)
- Implemented video pause during drag, resume after drag completes

### 6. Text Zoom Independence - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Time numbers and video clip titles were scaling with zoom, becoming unreadable
**Solution**:
- Applied inverse zoom transform to all text elements
- Set `zoomX: 1/zoom` and `zoomY: 1/zoom` for text objects
- Text now maintains consistent size regardless of zoom level
- Affects: time grid labels, clip titles, clip duration text

### 7. Trim Handle Persistence After Playback - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Trim handles reset to original positions after video playback when clicked again
**Solution**:
- Check if same clip already selected: `useTimelineStore.getState().selectedClipId === target.clipId`
- Only reset trim values when selecting a DIFFERENT clip
- Preserve tempTrimStart/tempTrimEnd when re-selecting same clip or trim handles
- Avoids stale closure by getting fresh state from store
**Impact**: Both left and right trim handles maintain position through pause/resume cycles

### 8. Timeline Header UX - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Header cluttered, buttons covering other controls, "Trimming:" text unnecessary
**Solution**:
- Removed "Trimming: [clipname]" text
- Made Apply/Cancel buttons smaller (px-3 py-1, text-xs)
- Repositioned trim buttons to LEFT of zoom controls
- Renamed "Split at Playhead" to "Split"
- Reorder/Split buttons always visible (removed `!isTrimming` condition)
**Impact**: Cleaner header, all controls accessible during trim mode

### 9. Clip Visual Improvements - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Selected clips darker than unselected (reversed), titles truncated
**Solution**:
- Reversed colors: selected = #60a5fa (light blue), unselected = #3b82f6 (dark blue)
- Updated hover: selected = #93c5fd, unselected = #60a5fa
- Changed fabric.Text to fabric.Textbox with wrapping
- Dynamic maxTextWidth: (clipWidth - 16) * zoom
**Impact**: Better visual hierarchy, full clip names visible on timeline

### 10. Media Library Display - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Clip names truncated, tooltips not working
**Solution**:
- Changed to text-sm with 2-line wrapping using -webkit-line-clamp
- Uses break-words for long filenames
- Removed non-functional tooltip in favor of visible wrapping
**Impact**: Full clip names visible in media library without truncation

## UI Polish Tasks - ALL COMPLETED ✅

### Testing Required - ALL PASSED ✅
1. ✅ Test complete workflow: import video → click timeline → select clip → drag trim handles → verify Apply button
2. ✅ Verify zoom functionality works correctly
