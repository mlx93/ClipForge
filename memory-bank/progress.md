## In Progress / Blocked

### Polish Features
- ⏳ Trim handle dragging (functional but UI issues)
- ⏳ Timeline zoom (buttons don't work)
- ⏳ Project save/load (not implemented)
- ⏳ Application menu (not implemented)
- ⏳ Export preview (not implemented)

### Critical Bugs - RESOLVED ✅
- ✅ Timeline playhead not responding to clicks - FIXED
- ✅ Video-timeline synchronization broken - FIXED
- ✅ Apply Trim button not visible - FIXED
- ✅ Trimmed clips don't visualize shorter - FIXED
- ✅ Playhead doesn't follow trim handles - FIXED

## Known Issues

### High Priority - RESOLVED ✅
1. ✅ **Sync Issues**: Video player, timeline playhead, and trim handles not synchronized - FIXED
2. ✅ **Trim Workflow**: Apply button never appears, can't complete trim - FIXED
3. ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clips don't show as shorter after trim - FIXED

### Medium Priority
4. **Timeline Zoom**: +/- buttons update state but don't affect canvas
5. **Performance**: Canvas re-rendering may be excessive

### Low Priority
6. **Project Management**: No save/load functionality yet
7. **Application Menu**: No menu bar shortcuts
8. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Not all implemented

## What Works
- ✅ Video import (drag & drop + file picker)
- ✅ Media library display
- ✅ Timeline rendering with clips
- ✅ Video player with controls
- ✅ Clip reordering (← → buttons)
- ✅ Split at playhead
- ✅ Video export (FFmpeg pipeline)
- ✅ DMG packaging

## What Doesn't Work - UPDATED
- ✅ Timeline click-to-seek - FIXED
- ✅ Video-timeline synchronization - FIXED
- ✅ Apply trim workflow - FIXED
- ✅ Trimmed clip visualization - FIXED
- ❌ Timeline zoom - Still needs work
- ✅ Playhead following trim handles - FIXED

## Remaining Work

### Critical Path (COMPLETED ✅)
1. ✅ Fix playhead synchronization - DONE
2. ✅ Fix Apply Trim button visibility - DONE
3. ✅ Fix trimmed clip visualization - DONE
4. ⏳ Test complete trim workflow - READY FOR TESTING

### Important Features
5. Implement timeline zoom
6. Add project save/load
7. Create application menu
8. Add export preview

### Nice to Have
9. Undo/redo functionality
10. Keyboard shortcuts for all actions
11. Performance optimizations

## Testing Status
- ✅ App launches successfully
- ✅ Videos import correctly
- ✅ Timeline displays clips
- ✅ Export creates MP4 files
- ❌ Trim functionality not working
- ❌ Sync issues block core workflow

## Code Quality
- TypeScript: Full type safety
- ESLint: Configured and passing
- Architecture: Clean separation of concerns
- State Management: Zustand working well
- IPC: Properly secured with preload

## Documentation
