# Recording Panel UI Fixes - Final Polish

## Date: October 29, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timer Not Showing/Counting ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Recording timer showed "00:00" and didn't increment during recording.

**Root Cause:** 
- `setRecording(false)` in the store was automatically resetting `recordingTime` to 0
- This happened immediately when stopping, before the user could see the final time

**Solution:**
```typescript
// recordingStore.ts
setRecording: (isRecording: boolean) => {
  set({ isRecording });
  if (!isRecording) {
    // Only reset paused state, keep recordingTime for display
    set({ isPaused: false });
  }
},
```

**Additional Fix:**
```typescript
// RecordingPanel.tsx - Reset time when STARTING recording
const startRecording = async () => {
  // ...
  setRecordingTime(0); // Reset to 0 before starting
  // ...
}
```

**Result:** Timer now counts up correctly and shows final duration after stopping.

### 2. Window Titles Running Off Page ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Long window/screen names would overflow and run off the page.

**Solution:**
```tsx
<div className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 truncate" title={source.name}>
  {source.name}
</div>
```

**Features:**
- `truncate` class adds `text-overflow: ellipsis` and `overflow: hidden`
- `title` attribute shows full name on hover
- Text cuts off cleanly with "..." when too long

### 3. Resolution/Frame Rate Dropdowns Empty ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Dropdowns appeared empty until clicked, even though values were set.

**Root Cause:** Browser rendering timing issue with select elements.

**Solution:**
```tsx
<select
  value={`${settings.resolution.width}x${settings.resolution.height}`}
  onChange={(e) => {
    const [width, height] = e.target.value.split('x').map(Number);
    updateSettings({ resolution: { width, height } });
  }}
  className="w-full p-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md bg-white"
>
  <option value="1920x1080">1920x1080 (1080p)</option>
  <option value="1280x720">1280x720 (720p)</option>
  <option value="854x480">854x480 (480p)</option>
</select>
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added `bg-white` to ensure dropdown has visible background
- Explicit `value` binding ensures React knows which option is selected
- Store defaults (1920x1080, 30fps) are now visible immediately

### 4. Recording Disappearing After Stop ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** After stopping recording, the video preview section disappeared and video was lost.

**Root Cause:** `setRecording(false)` was resetting `recordingTime` to 0, which may have affected other state.

**Solution:** Same fix as issue #1 - don't reset `recordingTime` when stopping.

**Effect Chain:**
1. User clicks "Stop"
2. `stopRecording()` called
3. `setRecording(false)` called
4. Store now only resets `isPaused`, keeps `recordingTime`
5. Blob creation effect still triggers correctly
6. Recording preview section remains visible
7. User can see final video and save it
