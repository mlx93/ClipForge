# Phase 1.75 Implementation - Agent Handoff Brief

> **Status Update**: Phase 1.75, Phase 2, and Phase 3 are now complete. All critical issues resolved and UI polish features implemented successfully. Phase 3 added keyboard shortcuts, hover previews, export time estimates, and comprehensive code cleanup.

## Mission
ClipForge's MVP is nearly complete, but during demo recording we discovered **6 critical video player and trim issues** that break core functionality and must be fixed before Phase 2 UI polish. Your task is to implement all fixes documented in `Post_PRD1_spec_middle.md` (270 lines), which provides detailed root cause analysis, fix strategies (pseudo-code/logic only), and comprehensive testing scenarios for each issue. **The most critical issue (#0) is that the video player's timestamp and progress bar freeze during playback** - they only update when pausing, creating a severely broken UX where users can't see current playback time.

## What You're Fixing

### üî¥ Priority 0 - CRITICAL (Fix First):
**Issue #0: Video Player Timestamp/Progress Bar Frozen (20 min)**
- **Problem**: Timeline playhead moves smoothly, but video player footer controls stay frozen
- **Root Cause**: Throttle effect with `[playhead]` dependency cancels setInterval on every 60fps update
- **Fix**: Remove throttling entirely, pass raw `playhead` to VideoControls (already React.memo)
- **Impact**: Users cannot see current time while video plays - SEVERE UX problem

### üî¥ Priority 1 - Blocking Issues (65 min):
**Issue #1 & #2: Timestamp/Total Duration Not Updating After Trim (15 min)**
- `updateClip` in timelineStore.ts doesn't recalculate `totalDuration`
- Race condition where VideoPreview reads stale state

**Issue #3: Ghost Playback Beyond Trim (30 min)**
- Video keeps playing past timeline end (31s, 32s, 33s...)
- RAF loop doesn't pause video element at last clip boundary

**Issue #4: Spacebar Causes Playhead Jump After Trim (10 min)**
- Playhead stays at old position after trim shortens timeline
- Needs adjustment if playhead > newTotalDuration

### üü° Priority 2 - UX Enhancements (75 min):
**Issue #5: No Pause at Trim Borders (45 min)**
- Add trimPreview state to timeline store
- RAF loop checks if playback reached trim end ‚Üí auto-pause
- Click trim handle ‚Üí seek playhead to that position

**Issue #8: Trim Precision (30 min)**
- Snap trim handles to 0.1s intervals
- Update formatTime to show "MM:SS.d" (e.g., "1:05.3")
- Visual flash on snap (optional)

## Implementation Guide

### Files You'll Modify:
1. `src/renderer/components/VideoPreview.tsx` (512 lines) - Issues #0, #3, #5
2. `src/renderer/store/timelineStore.ts` (189 lines) - Issues #1, #2, #5
3. `src/renderer/components/Timeline.tsx` (976 lines) - Issues #4, #5, #8

### Critical Safety Rules:
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT touch trim handle drag logic** (Timeline.tsx lines 408-559) - it's working perfectly after extensive debugging  
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT modify RAF loop dependencies** - only add logic inside existing loop  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Test after EVERY change** - these are delicate systems

### Fix Order (from spec):
1. **Issue #0** (20 min) - Video player timestamp frozen ‚Üí HIGHEST IMPACT
2. **Issue #1 & #2** (15 min) - Duration recalculation after trim
3. **Issue #3** (30 min) - Ghost playback past end
4. **Issue #4** (10 min) - Playhead jump after trim
5. **Issue #5** (45 min) - Pause at trim borders
6. **Issue #8** (30 min) - Trim precision snapping

**Total Time**: 2.5 hours

### Testing Strategy
`Post_PRD1_spec_middle.md` includes 5 comprehensive test scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: Basic trim workflow (duration updates, playback stops correctly)
- **Scenario 2**: Playhead adjustment after trim
- **Scenario 3**: Trim preview pause behavior
- **Scenario 4**: Precision snapping to 0.1s
- **Scenario 5**: Edge cases (first/last clip trims)

**Success Criteria**: All 6 issues resolved, all tests pass, no regressions in Phase 1/1.5 features.

## Why This Matters
These aren't nice-to-haves - they're **MVP blockers**. Issue #0 makes the video player appear completely broken. Issues #1-4 break the trim workflow (core feature). Issues #5 & #8 are critical for professional trim UX. Without these fixes, the demo video cannot be recorded and MVP cannot be submitted.

## After Completion
1. Test thoroughly (all 5 scenarios)
2. `npm run build` (verify no regressions)
3. Commit with message: "Phase 1.75: Fix critical video player and trim issues (6 fixes)"
4. Report back - ready for Phase 2 UI polish
